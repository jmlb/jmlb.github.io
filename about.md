<p>My background is in <strong>an Applied Physicist</strong> and in particular Advanced Magnetic Memory Technology (Bit Patterned Media, Templated Growth PMR, Orthogonal ST-RAM). 

My current interest is in Artificial Intelligence and more precisely Deep Learning for Computer Vision Application. 

I enjoy learning and keeping up-to-date with the latest technology: apply machine learning to a variety of data modalities: housing statistics, images. I am also interested in Self-Driving Cars: I am building a Autonomous model RC car: <i>Sonic</i>.</p>
