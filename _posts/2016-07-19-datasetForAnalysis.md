If you are looking for datasets to practice your **data analysis** and **Machine Learning** skills, here are a few websites. All the datasets listed are available for free.

### **CSIE** 
<a href="http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets"> <img src="/images/201607/CSIE_logo_small.png" width="100px"></a> **CSIE**'s page contains **Classification**, **Regression**, **multi-label** and string datasets from different sources including UCI, Statlog, StatLib. CSIE is the Department of Computer Science of the National Taiwan University. Despite a few broken links to the source of the dataset, the dataset itself can still be downloaded on CSIE website.

### **UCI**
<a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html"> <img src="/images/201607/uci.jpg" width="100px"></a>
UCI lists more than 400 datasets, from **Binary**, **Multivariate Classification**, to **Regression**. The page is maintained by the Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems of University of California Irvine. There is a very interesting [article]("http://www.machinelearningmastery.com/practice-machine-learning-from-the-uci-machine-learning-repository/"") about what's good or bad about the UCI datasets, and some advice on how to best use it.

### **Academic Torrent**
<a href="http://academictorrents.com"> <img src="/images/201607/torrent.png" width="200px"></a> The torrent site was created in 2014 by 2 researchers from the University of Massachusetts. The datasets are from a variety of sources (academic, industry): the dataset used for the Netflix challenge for example is available for download. You can also download research papers and courses: all the videos of CS231 Standford Course on Deep Learning can be downloaded. This is a great source to try yourself at **image processing**, **object recognition** algorithms.
