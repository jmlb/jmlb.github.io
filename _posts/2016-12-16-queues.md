In this last part of the series, we going to talk about **Queues**


1. [Linked Lists]({% post_url 2016-12-14-linked_lists %})
2. [Stacks]({% post_url 2016-12-15-stacks %})
3. Queues



In a Queue, it is **First in - First out**, i.e the oldest element comes out first. And the last element is the newest element.

Adding element to the *Tail* is called **Enqueue**, and removing element from the [Head] is called **Dequeue**.

The term **peek** means look at the head element.


### Deques
<hr>
A **Deque** is a Queue that goes both ways:  i.e it is a double ended Queue. You can Enqueue or Dequeue from both ends.



### Priority Queue
<hr>
In **Priority Queue**, a numerical priority is assigned to each element that are inserted into the Queues.

When an element is removed (dequeue), it will be the element with the highest priority. If the elements have same priority, then the oldest element is dequeued.


### Quizz
<hr>
*Make a Queue class using a list!
Hint: You can use any Python list method
you'd like! Try to write each one in as 
few lines as possible. Make sure you pass the test cases too!*

class Queue:
    def __init__(self, head=None):
        self.storage = [head]

    def enqueue(self, new_element):
        self.storage.append(new_element)

    def peek(self):
        if len(self.storage) == 0:
            return None
        else:
            return self.storage[0]

    def dequeue(self):
        if len(self.storage) != 0:
            self.storage.pop(0)
            return self.storage[0]
            
    
# Setup
q = Queue(1)
q.enqueue(2)
q.enqueue(3)

# Test peek
# Should be 1
print q.peek()

# Test dequeue
# Should be 1
print q.dequeue()

# Test enqueue
q.enqueue(4)
# Should be 2
print q.dequeue()
# Should be 3
print q.dequeue()
# Should be 4
print q.dequeue()
q.enqueue(5)
# Should be 5
print q.peek()
