The name of the virtual environment is: `py2env`.

## 1. Create the Virtualenv 

From the Terminal, go to the user folder and create the virtualenv:

`$ cd ~
 $ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 py2env `

If there is an error, try installing `python-dev`:

` sudo apt-get install python-dev `


A new folder is created: `py2env`.
