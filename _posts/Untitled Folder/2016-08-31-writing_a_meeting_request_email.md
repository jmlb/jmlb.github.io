I’d love to learn more about what your company does, in what areas you might need more support . So, please, let me knwo if you can be available for a coffee or at your office for a chat.


Thanks so much,

Jean-Marc



Thank you for connecting with me on LinkedIn last week. It’s such a pleasure to meet you!

I saw your article published on LinkedIn about career development for Millennials and thought it offered some great advice. I was wondering if we could speak further about your thoughts on job search tips for Millennials.





send a follow-up email.

Dear [his or her name],

I hope you’re having a great week! I wanted to follow up on my request for an informational interview. As I explained in my previous email, [reason why this person has impressed you] and I’d love to hear about [questions you’d like to ask]. I’m happy to meet whenever and wherever is convenient for you. However, if your schedule is too full, I completely understand.

Best,

[Your name]

You’d be shocked at the number of people who don’t respond to your first query but do get back to you after the second. What I’ve learned from that is that most people aren’t ignoring you, the first email just arrived at an inopportune time to answer and was then forgotten.

However, if you’ve sent the second email and you still hear nothing, move on to your next prospect. There are plenty of people who will talk to you, so don’t spend too much energy chasing down one person. 


After you’ve taken my template and made it your own, I’m confident you’ll be going on tons of coffee dates of your own. Good luck!


You’re making a request for advice and information, not a job,” Barritt explains. “If there are no openings, and you ask for a job, they might step back. But if you say, ‘I’d like to pick your brain about opportunities in marketing in the Burlington, Vermont, area,’ and you provide a little information about what you’re trying to find out, then they’re more open to your request.” And if you don’t hear from them right away, they may just be busy; politely follow up again, once or twice. After that, it’s probably best to drop your request for an informational interview.


Don’t forget to follow up with a thank you to both the person whom you interviewed and, if applicable, the contact who sent you. “You can finish your informational interview by asking, ‘May I keep in touch with you?’ That’s the beginning of the networking, so then you can write back, even a year later, and say, ‘I just wanted you to know I’ve taken such-and-such job,’” Barritt explains. “Now there is a collegiality built. You never know when you might be needing to connect with the person again.”


 “I'd love to take you to a quick coffee so I can hear your perspective on this industry and what it's like to work at your company. I’ll actually be in your area next week and would be happy to meet you wherever is convenient for you.”


3. Have a Hook

A great way to increase your chance of landing the interview is to demonstrate why you really want to meet with this person. Do you admire her career path? Do you think the work he’s currently doing at company X stands out as the best? Maybe you have a shared connection and think she would be a great voice of wisdom. Don’t be afraid to share why you are specifically reaching out to this person. The more personalized your ask feels, the greater chance of success you’ll have.


4. Be Very Considerate

Remember that, in asking for an informational interview, you’re literally asking someone to put his or her work on hold to help you. Show your contact you understand this by saying, “I can only imagine how busy you must get, so even 15-20 minutes would be so appreciated.”


5. Make Sure You Don't Seem Like You’re Looking for a Job (Even if You Are)

If you sound like you’re really just looking for a job, there’s a good chance this person will push you to HR or the company’s career page. So be sure to make it clear that you really want to talk to this person to learn about his or her career history and perspective on the job or industry. After you meet and make a great impression is when you can mention the job hunt.
